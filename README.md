Bomberman
======

This project was made in our second year of college as a way to improve our skills and knowledge of Java. For its development we used a 2D java game library called Slick (http://slick.ninjacave.com/).

The game features 6 single player levels with different enemies and a local multiplayer mode. In terms of development, we programmed an engine to deal with object collisions caused by movement and by bomb explosions. This engine was also responsible for all the logic of the game, including the movement of bomberman and its enemies, the power-ups activation, the music and the score tracker. All of the colisions are checked troughout pixel evualations based on the position of the elements on the screen. The slick engine was majorily used for the sprite animations and for the level layout of the game.
